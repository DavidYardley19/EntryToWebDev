                Note: 
                Remember that input are self closing
                action attribute within form tags are where the form is to be submitted to

                I believe ID is to be unique to each input however the name can be the same in order to only have one option available?

                <!--
                    Labels allow you to associate the text with radio buttons so that these can be clicked aswell!
                    Notice that when this is ran, you can also click the name "Milk" to switch the radio button.
                -->

                <!--
                    The id attribute within an input element is to uniquely identify HTML elements.
                    Probably good practice to treat these as variable names,
                        Try not to start them with a capital or number > Unless they are CONSTANTS perhaps
                        Utilise camelCase or under_lines when naming.

                <label><input type="radio" name="preferedDrink" id="water">Water</label>
    
                <!--
                    To avoid having two radio buttons being selected at the same time, you will need a name that matches for all of them.
                    Here, we have name="preferedDrink"
                    When one option is already selected and you wish to choose another option, then the previous one will be deselected.

            <h3>Working with value attributes</h3>
            <p>
                When utilising input tags, the data being submitted from the form are based on the name and value attributes
            </p>
            <!--
                Above you will notice that no value attribute has been assigned, this means that it will be automatically set to the name-name = on... e.g. preferedDrink=on
                    This is not ideal when you have more than two values.

                NOTE:
                    REMEMBER: ATTRIBUTES name AND value ARE RETURNED!
                
                For the sake of argument, just use value = id for now... You could just set them to integer values like 1,2,3 and so on and so forth.
