    <!-- The above can be used instead, link a html doc to its stylesheet. Remember that this is self closing.
        rel stands for relation to the html document. Critical for defining how the linked resource is to be understood - almost like a protocol

        other values for rel may include
            icon
            alternate
            author
            canonical
            preload
            manifest
            dns-prefetch
            preconnect
            prefetch
