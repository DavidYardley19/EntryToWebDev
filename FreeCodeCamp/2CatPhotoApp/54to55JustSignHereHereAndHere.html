    <!--
        Random tag:
            details (+summary)
        details tag allows you to create a collapsable content widget within the page. This allows the user to shrink the options present.

        I like this one... A lot

        It is often paired with a summary tag to provide a caption for the collapsable content, this does not get hidden when interacted with.
        The summary text also acts like a label in that clicking it, will also switch the collapsable content.

        <summary>What is the difference between a checkbox and a radiobox?</summary>
        <p>The radio box typically only allows for one input from a set of options
            <br>
            Meanwhile, checkboxes typically allow the user to enter more than one input from the options provided

                        Well, it does make the whole thing a lot more readable. Imagine that you are already working in a big team.
                        The br tags also assist with this.
                        I like to have them on a seperate line to really space the thing out. Make's it obvious rather than read the end of each line.

                        The reasoning for having the name as the same is so that they can be submitted as a group
                        The reasoning for having the square brackets[] at the end of the name: tasks, is to signify that this will be sent to an array. 
                        The values will need to be different when working with the same name.

                    <!--
                        However, if in another case, you want each checkbox to represent a different field or piece of data, ensure that the name is set uniquely
                        The values can be the same here in some instances.
