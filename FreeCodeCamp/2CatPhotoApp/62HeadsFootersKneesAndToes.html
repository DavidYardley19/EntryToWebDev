<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--
    Two above always need to be outside the head
    They specify the entire content of the page.
    Language of the page is specified with the lang attribute within html tag.

    !DOCTYPE > special string AKA declaration.
    This ensures the browser meets industry wide specs >> also tells the browser that the doc is a HTML5 (latest vers)

<!--
    Typically I just add the basic boilerplate code by typing "!"
    or "!!!" at the start.
    Here I will explain more points.

    Points:
    Head element used to contain metadata
        title
        links to stylesheets and scripts
            AKA encapsulated data.

    The title element sahows what is in the title bar of the page > the very top

    meta tag > sets the browsers behavior 
    SELF CLOSING
    the charset attribute decides on how the doc encodes characters

<body>
    <h1>Heads and Feet</h1>
    <main>
        <section>

        </section>
        <section>

        </section>
    </main>

    <!--
        Make sure that the footer element stays within the body element!
    -->

    <footer>
        <h4>
            This will appear at the bottom of the screen.
        </h4>
        <p>
            Footers typically contain information about:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>The author</li>
                <li>Copyright data</li>
                <li>Links to terms of use</li>
                <li>Contact information</li>
                <li>Further on so on and so forth.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </footer>
