            So it looks like p is more plain
            Whilst the b tag looks more bold. Seems to stand out a little more but may not be ideal for some circumstances.

        <strong> This is the same as a b tag... But semantically better. Easier to read. It carries additional meaning.</strong>
        <p>
            Note <br>
            The "strong" tag is given more 'weight' than the b tag when considered by Search Engine Optimisers (SEO)
