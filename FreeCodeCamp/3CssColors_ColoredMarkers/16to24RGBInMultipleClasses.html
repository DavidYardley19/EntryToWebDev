<!-- Top tip

    Same way for adding classes with tags, you can add multiple classes, seperated by full stops
    Example:
        tag.ClassOne.ClassTwo

-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Colored Markers</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="16to24styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>CSS Color Markers</h1>
    <div class="container">

        <!-- 

            When adding multiple classes, it doesnt matter what order they go in the html file
            However the prescedence is decided in the styles file 
                > The one that is written lower down in the file overwrites the previous one if the same properties are used.
                You can also introduce the !important keyword to mark one class as the overwriter' as I'd like to call it.

      <div class="marker one">
      </div>
      <div class="marker two">
      </div>
      <div class="marker three">
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
