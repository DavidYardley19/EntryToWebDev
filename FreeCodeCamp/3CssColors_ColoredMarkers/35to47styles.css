/* NOTES

  Color wheel is where similar hues are near each other, different ones are futher apart.
  e.g. pure red is next to orange and rose.

  Two colors that are opposite are called complementary colors.
  If combined: they produce grey.
    But when placed next to each other, they are highly contrasted.
