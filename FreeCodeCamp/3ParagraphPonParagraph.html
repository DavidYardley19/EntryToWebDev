            Today I woke up really early, about an hour and a half ago!
            I took the dog on a walk and already had 3 cups of tea... Perhaps I shouldnt have, we will see.

        <p>
            t = 1205 <br>
            Still on top of the game right now.
            Managed to ring my family from abroad, they've just got a new cat called Felix!
            I'm about to get some violin practice in, feeling pumped!
        </p>

            t = 1640 <br>
            Right...
            Maybe too many teas this morning! I'm really feeling a dip in my energy.
            It's almost like I was borrowing energy from later today.
            Perhaps I will limit myself to just the one tea going forward.

            t = 0830 <br>
            Only had the one tea this morning
            I don't really feel as pumped as last time I drank tea but I'm sure my body will thank me
        </p>

            t = 1500 <br>
            Feeling a lot better today now that I have cut down my tea consumption.
            Still managed to take the pupper out on a walk and catch up with the family abroad.
            Although it does appear Felix made a mess in their Kitchen.

            Bless him. Still a kitten going through training :&#41;
